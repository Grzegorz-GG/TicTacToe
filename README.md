# TicTacToe
It's a simple TicTacToe game written in JavaFX. 
This application works as follows:
-mouse click on an cell within the grid pane triggers a mouse event,
-mouse event draws two diagonal lines ('X') or ellipse ('O') and puts one of these objects in a selected cell
-the game is over if there is a draw (nobody wins and all cells are occupied) or if one of the players puts three tokens
('X' o 'O') in one row, one column, in a diagonal (or subdiagonal) of the grid pane.
